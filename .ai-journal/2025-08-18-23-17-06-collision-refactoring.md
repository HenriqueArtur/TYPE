## Summary
**Session Impact**: Refactored the collision system in the Bunny class to use proper Body component encapsulation instead of directly manipulating MatterBody objects. This improves the separation of concerns and ensures that the Body component maintains full control over position updates.

## Interaction Log

### 23:17:06 - Collision system refactoring
**User Request**: Refactor collisions so that the Body component changes its own position instead of using MatterBody directly in Bunny

**Planned Steps**:
1. Examine current Bunny collision implementation
2. Review Body component current responsibilities
3. Refactor Bunny to use Body component for position updates
4. Test collision system after refactoring

**What Actually Happened**:
- Analyzed Bunny.ts and found it was directly using `MatterBody.setPosition()` on line 35-38
- Reviewed BodyComponent.ts and RectangularBodyComponent.ts to understand current architecture
- Added `setPosition(x: number, y: number)` method to base BodyComponent class
- Overrode `setPosition()` in RectangularBodyComponent to update internal x/y properties
- Removed MatterBody import from Bunny.ts and replaced direct Matter.js calls with `this.body.setPosition()`
- Added comprehensive tests for the new `setPosition` method:
  - 4 tests for BodyComponent.setPosition(): basic position updates, negative coordinates, decimal coordinates, initial position verification
  - 5 tests for RectangularBodyComponent.setPosition(): internal coordinate syncing, position override, negative/decimal handling, property preservation
- Fixed test assertion that was checking body.friction directly instead of component.value().friction
- Ran comprehensive test suite: type checking, linting, 175 unit tests, and build - all passed
- Biome automatically fixed import order in BodyComponent.ts

**Result**: Successfully refactored collision system with proper encapsulation and comprehensive test coverage. The Body component now maintains full control over position updates, improving code architecture and separation of concerns. All 175 tests pass and build succeeds.
