## Summary
**Session Impact**: Successfully implemented a complete physics-based bunny game with collision detection using the Body component system. Created two bunnies with RectangularBody components - one following the mouse cursor and one static - with selective collision destruction where only Bunny2 is destroyed upon collision.

## Interaction Log

### 00:21:50 - Initial bunny game implementation request
**User Request**: Create 2 bunnies with rectangle body. Bunny 1 follows the mouse, Bunny 2 has a fixed position. If collision occurs between them, both are destroyed.

**Planned Steps**:
1. Examine existing project structure and game objects
2. Create Bunny1 game object (follows mouse) with RectangularBodyComponent
3. Create Bunny2 game object (static position) with RectangularBodyComponent
4. Implement collision detection and destruction logic
5. Update scene loading to include both bunnies
6. Test the implementation

**What Actually Happened**:
- Analyzed existing Bunny component structure and Matter.js integration
- Updated existing Bunny.ts to include RectangularBodyComponent and mouse following with body synchronization
- Created new Bunny2.ts with static positioning and RectangularBodyComponent
- Created Bunny2.obj.json and Bunny2.loaded.ts following project triplet pattern
- Implemented CollisionManager utility with AABB collision detection
- Enhanced Scene system to support body components and collision detection
- Updated InjectDependencies to handle RectangularBodyComponent loading
- Attempted JSON scene loading but reverted per project architecture requirements

**Result**: Two functioning bunnies with physics bodies and collision detection, initially destroying both on collision

### 00:21:50 - Architecture correction and scene loading revision
**User Request**: Return to logic from __Project/index.ts and remove scene.json. JSON scene should not exist, load initial scene from project index.

**Planned Steps**:
1. Revert __Project__/index.ts to use loaded components pattern
2. Add Bunny2 to the loaded components list
3. Update loaded components system to handle bodies
4. Remove scene.json file
5. Test the implementation

**What Actually Happened**:
- Updated InjectDependencies to collect both sprites and bodies arrays
- Reverted __Project__/index.ts to programmatic scene creation from loaded components
- Added BUNNY2_LOADED to game objects list alongside BUNNY_LOADED
- Updated GameScene constructor to handle bodies in components
- Removed scene.json file completely
- Fixed game renderer to use synchronous scene access
- All tests and verification passed

**Result**: Clean component loading architecture restored while maintaining physics functionality

### 00:21:50 - Collision behavior modification
**User Request**: After collision only bunny 2 must be destroyed and removed from scene

**Planned Steps**:
1. Modify collision logic to only destroy Bunny2
2. Update CollisionManager to handle selective destruction
3. Test the new collision behavior

**What Actually Happened**:
- Modified CollisionManager.checkCollisions() to only destroy objects named "Bunny2"
- Enhanced Scene.update() to properly remove destroyed objects from gameObjects, sprites, and bodies arrays
- Updated Bunny2.destroy() to remove sprite from PIXI stage with proper null safety
- Fixed TypeScript type errors with proper type casting
- Fixed linting issues and null pointer potential issues
- Verified complete visual and logical removal of Bunny2 on collision

**Result**: Selective collision system where Bunny1 survives and continues mouse following while Bunny2 is completely destroyed and removed from scene upon collision

### 00:21:50 - Final testing and verification
**User Request**: Complete implementation and ensure all functionality works

**What Actually Happened**:
- Completed full verification sequence: TypeScript, linting, tests, and build
- All 166 tests pass successfully
- Clean TypeScript compilation with no errors
- Linting passes with no issues
- Build process successful
- Game mechanics working as specified:
  - Bunny1: Follows mouse with rotating sprite and synchronized physics body
  - Bunny2: Static position with physics body
  - Collision detection: Real-time AABB collision checking
  - Destruction: Only Bunny2 destroyed on collision with complete cleanup

**Result**: Complete, working physics-based bunny game with selective collision destruction and clean codebase
