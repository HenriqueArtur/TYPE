## Summary
**Session Impact**: Successfully refactored the world update system from PIXI.js Ticker-based updates to Matter.js physics engine updates. Implemented comprehensive physics integration with PhysicsEngine and PhysicsWorldManager classes, following TDD methodology. The system now uses Matter.js for world updates while maintaining sprite-body synchronization for visual rendering.

## Interaction Log

### 00:10:49 - Matter.js physics world integration
**User Request**: Change the way to update world instead use PIXI.js to update world, use Matter.js to update

**Planned Steps**:
1. Examine current world update mechanism using PIXI.js
2. Understand Matter.js world update requirements
3. Write tests for Matter.js world update system
4. Implement Matter.js Engine integration
5. Refactor Scene to use Matter.js world updates
6. Update components to sync with Matter.js world
7. Test the refactored world update system

**What Actually Happened**:
- **Analysis Phase**: 
  - Examined current PIXI.js Ticker-based update system in game/index.ts and Scene/index.ts
  - Identified that world updates were driven by PIXI.js rendering cycles
  
- **TDD Implementation**:
  - Created comprehensive test suites for PhysicsEngine and PhysicsWorldManager (29 new tests)
  - Implemented PhysicsEngine class: wraps Matter.js Engine with gravity control, body management, and world updates
  - Implemented PhysicsWorldManager class: manages body components, sprite-body linking, and synchronization
  
- **System Integration**:
  - Added PhysicsWorldManager to GameScene for physics world management
  - Integrated body components and sprite-body linking in scene construction
  - Replaced PIXI.js Ticker with requestAnimationFrame-based game loop in renderer/game/index.ts
  - Modified Scene.update() to use physics world updates with automatic sprite synchronization
  
- **Component Updates**:
  - Added Angle.fromRadians() method for physics angle conversion
  - Updated Bunny classes to work with physics-driven positioning
  - Modified game objects to let physics control position while maintaining manual rotation
  
- **Architecture Improvements**:
  - Physics world now drives position updates, with sprites automatically synced
  - Matter.js handles collision detection and physics simulation
  - Clean separation between physics (Matter.js) and rendering (PIXI.js)
  - Proper resource management with destroy methods for physics components

**Result**: Successfully migrated from PIXI.js-driven updates to Matter.js physics-driven world updates. The new system provides proper physics simulation with automatic sprite synchronization. All 226 tests pass and build succeeds. The architecture now properly separates physics simulation from visual rendering, enabling realistic physics-based gameplay while maintaining visual fidelity.
