## Summary
**Session Impact**: Successfully refactored the destroy system following TDD methodology. Changed from optional `onDestroy?()` to mandatory `destroy()` in GameObject and implemented destroy methods across all components. This ensures proper resource cleanup and consistent destruction behavior throughout the engine.

## Interaction Log

### 23:32:55 - Destroy system refactoring using TDD
**User Request**: Refactor destroy logic - change `onDestroy?()` to `destroy()` in GameObject and implement mandatory destroy methods in components. Use components destroy logic in Bunny classes. Follow TDD approach.

**Planned Steps**:
1. Examine current destroy logic in GameObject and components
2. Write tests for destroy method in each component
3. Change onDestroy?() to destroy() in GameObject
4. Implement destroy() method in all components
5. Update Bunny classes to use component destroy logic
6. Test the refactored destroy system

**What Actually Happened**:
- **Red Phase**: Added comprehensive destroy tests for all components (TextureComponent, TransformComponent, SpriteComponent, BodyComponent, RectangularBodyComponent) - all initially failed as expected
- **Green Phase**: 
  - Changed `onDestroy?(): void {}` to `destroy(): void {}` in AbstractGameObject.ts:23
  - Added abstract `destroy(): void` to GameComponent base class
  - Implemented destroy methods in all components:
    - TextureComponent: destroys PIXI texture instance and nullifies reference
    - TransformComponent: resets to default values (position: 0,0, scale: 1,1, rotation: 0Â°)
    - SpriteComponent: removes from parent, destroys sprite instance, destroys texture and transform components
    - BodyComponent: resets physics properties to defaults
    - RectangularBodyComponent: resets dimensions and position, calls parent destroy
- Updated Bunny classes to call component destroy methods instead of manual cleanup
- Fixed SpriteComponent destroy to handle multiple calls safely with proper type checking
- All 194 tests pass, type checking successful, linting passed, build successful
- Biome automatically fixed formatting across 5 files

**Result**: Successfully implemented TDD-driven destroy system refactoring. All components now have mandatory, well-tested destroy methods that properly clean up resources. The system ensures consistent destruction behavior and prevents memory leaks by properly destroying PIXI instances and resetting component states.
